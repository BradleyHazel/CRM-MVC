## Project Description

The application's main use is to enable the user to keep track of customer information as well as keep track of open and paid invoices for those customers.

![Login Page]()

The user can either register with a username, email, and password, or they can use Google Oauth2 SSO. If the user forgets their password they can have a temporary password emailed to their registered email, which they can then change using the change password function.

The main page displays the customer list as well as charts to keep track of AR management, customer country demographic, customer lifetime revenue, total monthly revenue, and 1 year projected revenue.

There is also a separate customer list and invoice list which are filterable by customer name, invoice amount, invoice date, and paid status where available.

The individual customer details page for each customer features all of the details available, including a customer photo, email, phone, website, address, city, zip code, notes, the created date, the customer country, and the state. All of the relevant invoices are also linked and a button to mark the individual invoice is available. The user can edit the customer on this page and delete the customer as well which will delete all of the invoices for the customer.

The individual invoice details page for each invoice features all of the invoice details available, including the customer name with link, invoice amount, due date, invoice date, contact name, contact number, paid status, billing address, invoice line items, memo, created date, and payment information. The user can edit the invoice on this page, mark it as paid, and delete the invoice.

New customers and invoices can be added from the Add a Customer and Add an invoice page. You must select a customer to be able to generate an invoice.

The username or Google name is displayed at the top of the page. All creations, updates, and deletions are logged for future tracking on the logs page.
